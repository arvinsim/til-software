* How to Turn Off Notifications in Skype

I searched for plugins to be able to silence notifications from Skype to no avail. It turns out that the solution is very simple.

To do it, just set your status to *Do not disturb*. I thought this status was just for aesthetic purposes only. I did not know it actually blocks notifications from reaching you.
