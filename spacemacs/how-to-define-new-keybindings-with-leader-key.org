* How to define new keybindings with leader key


** To set a new keybindings with the leader key, use this format

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "<key> <key> ..." '<commnd>)
#+END_SRC

Examples: 

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "o a" 'org-agenda)
#+END_SRC

The code above allows you to call the `org-agenda` command by pressing
the leader followed by the lowercase 'o' and 'a'

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(spacemacs/set-leader-keys "SPC" 'avy-goto-char-timer)
#+END_SRC

Pressing the leader key followed by the space bar will execute the
'avy-goto-char-timer' command

** Note

If there are keybinding conflicts between the system default configuration
and the user configuration, the user alwasys takes precedence.
