* Execute a program from terminal without waiting for program to close

To run a program without making the shell wait for it until it closes,
add a "&" at the end of your command.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
For example, if we want to run the "emacs" command without waiting,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
emacs README.org &
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE
